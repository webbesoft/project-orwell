Project Orwell - I'm very picky about what I want in a writing app. This is my attempt at building that.

## Usage

1. Install Rust by following its [getting-started guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
   Once this is done, you should have the `rustc` compiler and the `cargo` build system installed in your `PATH`.
2. Clone or download this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/slint-ui/slint-rust-template my-project
   cd my-project
   ```
3. Build with `cargo`:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```
4. Run the application binary:
   ```
   cargo run
   ```

Made using [Slint](https://slint.rs/) for the user interface.
